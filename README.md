This respiratory holds the documentation for the project. You can view the project at https://govee.tinkertechlab.com/dash

## Contributing

Want to contribute to the overall design and/or structure of the platform? Please [Contribute to Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Suggesting Changes

Have an improvement to make but don't know how to implement it? Submit [an issue](https://github.com/TinkerTechLab/TTLxGOVEE-Documentation/issues) and our maintainers will take care of it! Be sure to provide as much information as possible.

### Pull Requests

Download the `dev` branch to your PC, and install NPM (Node.js v18+ is also required).

To start the development server, run `npm run start` from the directory that contains the files. Open `localhost:3000` or `<localIP>:3000` to view changes live as you make them.

To generate static resources for the project, run `npm run build` and open the new directory `/build` that was created

To contribute, upload any changes you made to `.md` files within the `docs` directory, as well as the new build files.

>IMPORTANT! Make sure to re-upload the _entire_ `build` directory when creating a pull request, as Docusaurus modifies the filenames of scripts and other assets linked on each page!
