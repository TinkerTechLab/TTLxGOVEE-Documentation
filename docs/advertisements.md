# Advertisements

This article helps explain why we show Advertisements on various pages of the service, and describes how you can support us!

## Why do we display Advertisements throughout out site?

Running this service is not cheap. Between our Discord bot, Time Pattern Automation triggers, and multiple concurrent users, we have to pay various fees to keep this service up and running (Electricity is also unfortunately not free). Revenue from Advertisements helps us pay these fees.

Please don't disable your ad-blocker on our site. While advertisements may be annoying, we do our best to place as few on the page as possible, and we'll never show advertisement pop-ups (Or pop-unders) to annoy you. Even if you don't click, leaving Advertisements enabled helps us earn back the costs that your use of the platform creates.

## I can't afford a premium plan. Is there a different way I can help out?

Yes! Please see the following ways that you can help us out without upgrading your account to a paid plan
