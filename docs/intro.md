## Getting Started

Get started by [creating an account](https://govee.tinkertechlab.com/signup?ref=docs) and linking your GOVEE API key.

## What you'll need

- An email address (Any one will do!)
- An Authenicator App
- Your GOVEE API key (See [Finding your API key](#finding-your-govee-api-key) below)

### Finding your GOVEE API Key

1. Open the GOVEE Home app on iOS or Android (Please note that using the GOVEE Studio or Lite app _will not work_)

2. Select the profile icon (The bottom-leftmost icon on your screen)

3. Click on the cog wheel (The upper-rightmost icon on the profile page)

4. Scroll down, and select "Apply for API Key"

5. Submit the forum to request your API key

6. Check your email for a message from `api-support@govee.com`. It may take a few minutes to arrive

7. Your API key will be attached in the message. Copy it into [the signup form](https://govee.tinkertechlab.com/signup) when prompted!

## Controlling your devices

Once you create your account and link your GOVEE devices via the API, you'll see an easy-to-navigate control panel where you can manage your devices! Here are just a few of the amazing things you can do on your homepage:

- Turn on (or off) a device
- Set the brightness of the device
- Set the target temperature for the device (Ex: Heaters)
- Set the ColorTemperature for the device (For devices with special LEDs for this)
- Set the RGB color for the device
- Apply any of your custom DIYs, or use a preset scene / music mode from GOVEE!

Explore the dashboard for yourself to see all the options offered to each of your devices!
