# Using Multiple GOVEE API Keys

Have multiple GOVEE accounts you want to control? Good news! We support the usage of up to 3 connected GOVEE API keys

Please note that unless otherwise specified, the phrase "API Key" references GOVEE API keys in this article (Instead of TTL API Keys)

## Managing Multiple Keys

Managing your connected API keys is easy!

- [Login to the control panel](https://govee.tinkertechlab.com/dash) and select your profile icon in the upper-right hand corner.

- From the dropdown, select the "Setting" option, and scroll down until you see the "API Key Setup" option (On wider screens, you'll find this option on the right-hand side)

- You'll have the option to add, change and remove each of your API keys individually. Additionally, you'll have the option to change the security level for each key.

(Note: See [this page](/docs/GOVEE-API-Keys/security-levels) for information on each of the two security levels)

### Becoming a Paid User

You may notice that you need to upgrade to a paid plan in order to add additional API keys. Unfortunately, loading in all your devices, scenes, and more is quite a bit resource-intensive (Especially when you have quite the collection of devices).

We try our very best to keep every feature free, but increasing server costs means we have to put restrictions somewhere. Not only are our paid plans as cheap as we can make them, but every dollar made from this project goes right back to it (From better servers, and support for the latest API options). The goal of this project is not to make profit, but to make controlling your GOVEE devices easier then ever.

Supporting this project unlocks additional features (Like multiple API keys, higher rate limits, and more). You can learn more about our paid plans and why we offer them [here](/docs/upgrading). If you choose to upgrade (Thank you!), please login to your account, then navigate to the [upgrade page](https://govee.tinkertechlab.com/upgrade).
